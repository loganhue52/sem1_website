                            <p>&emsp;<b>The Bander Believers Society</b> is a group of high minded indivuals who worship the one and only Lord Bander.
                            Lord Bander, known as Nic Bander, is a highly praised and beloved teacher at the Southern Indiana Career and Technical Center.

                                <h5><b>Our School-Appropriate Rituals</b></h5>
                            </div>

                                <li><b>The Destruction Ritual</b> is an Office Space type ritual where we get together and destroy old, slow, and ancient piece of technology. Such technology consists of old high school Dell Optiplex computers, any beige-colored printer, or even broken Kurigs. Baseball bats will be provided.</li>
                                <li><b>The Rubby Ducky Prayer Ritual</b> is one of our most sacred rituals. A large (10ft x 10ft), yellow rubber duck is inflated and we gather in a perfectly even circle around the duck. We stand, bow our heads, and recite a latin phrase which will tell the rubby ducky gods to give Lord Bander good luck and rich fortune. It is definitely not an ancient latin prayer to summon a god. No need to worry, pieces of old Yellow Pages books will be provided with the prayer written on them over the old Yellow Pages text.</li> 
                                <li><b>The Bandermon Ritual</b> is a fun card game similar to Pokemon where each Pokemon's face has been replaced the same picture of Lord Bander on each card. Players will hold duels against each other in a tournament style. Instead of gambling with real money, because everybody is broke is this day and age, we bet on the winner with Kurig Cups, known as K-Cups. Each K-Cup is equal to one dollar. An example picture of a Bandermon card is displayed to the left.</li>
